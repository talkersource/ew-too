  reset_session - This command can be used to reset the session counter, and
		allow the session to be reset before the normal time limit has
		expired.  It's not just so that you can set a session whenever
		you feel like it (and you'll get a proper telling-off if you
		do use it like that) - it's so that an offensive session can
		be changed.

  Format: reset_session
