  splat - squish's sexier cousin command, which is functionally almost
		identical to squish.  The difference is that rather than just
		preventing that one person from logging in for a time, you
		prevent everyone from that SITE from logging in for the
		specified time.  Needless to say, if you abuse this one, we'll
		be having your dangly bits for earrings pretty sharpish.

  Format: splat <name> <time>
