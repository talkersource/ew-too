  newbies - This command can be used to temporarily close off EW-too to
		non resident characters.  Use this if there are a series of
		people logging in as newbies, and being offensive, and it's
		becoming too much hassle to keep ejecting them all.  The
		command can be used as a toggle, but is best used if given an
		argument.  The arguments are:
		? - will tell you whether the program is open or closed to
			newbies.
		on - will close the program to newbies, and send a message to
			all connected SU's to tell them this.
		off - will reopen the program, and inform connected SU's of
			this.
