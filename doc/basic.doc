	Okay, so, now you're a Basic SuperUser, what do you do?  Well, the
main task you will have as a member of staff is to give newbies residency and
help them out. You are also completely responsible to the administrator who
sponsored you, just as they are responsible for anything you do.

	Remember to use the commands fairly and in an unbiased way, naturally
anybody who is found abusing the commands (ie ejecting newbies for a laugh..)
will be roasted over hot coals.  If you have any questions then ask your
sponsor..

	To help you be a help to other people, you now get to play with some
new commands, which have helpfiles, which you can read in the usual way (For
those of you who never bothered to use the help, the syntax is: 'help
<command>' :-) ).  These commands are:

	eject		newbies		privs
	resident	su		suemote
	list_su		list_new	boot
	off_duty	assist		reset_session
	warn
