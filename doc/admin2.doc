list_all_notes		- Lists all the notes in all the buckets (pointless
			  but interesting)	
list_su			- Lists all the superusers (and their rank) that
			  are logged onto the program.
list_new		- Lists all the newbies on the program.
make			- create a character, takes arg of name, and
			  email address sets the password of the
			  character to the same as the name
			  (this should be used for when the person
			  isn't on 'resident' should be used otherwise)
malloc			- various memory things
newbies			- open / close the prog to newbies
nuke			- wipes the player file from someone. If the
			  someone is on the program, kick them off.
			  (this is also the way to unbanish someone)
privs			- can be used with argument to give privs of
			  someone else (not necessarily on the program
			  either) 
resident		- make someone a resident (this should be used
			  in preference to 'grant whoever residency'
			  as it gives all the proper messages) 
remove			- remove a priv from someone (works directly
			  on player files too)
remove_shout		- removes shout from someone for a period.
			  positive argument removes for that length of
			  time (in seconds). Negative argument removes
			  permanently. (an argument of 1 resets the 
			  counter so the player can shout again)
remove_note		- destroy a note in the note tables (to be
			  used only with stray notes that don't appear
			  tagged anywhere, or for cleaning up purposes)
reset_squish		- Allows someone to log on, if they have been
			  prevented from doing so by the squish command.
restore			- load player files up from the disk (DON'T USE)
reload			- reload various info files (ie help / motd / 
			  the connections messages, site banish list,
			  etc etc) so editing of said messages can be
			  done on the fly
seeecho			- toggle on and off whether you see who echoes
			  what.
site			- list people who have connected from the same
			  domain or host. Argument can be IP number
			  with * wildcards, or name of someone on the
			  prog 
su			- message to superusers only (from eject
			  upwards) on the prog
splat			- This squishes someone, and then bans their site
			  _totally_ for a minute.
