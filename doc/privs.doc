  privs - Lets you look at the priv level of another user.  Otherwise, it's
		functionally identical to the way the privs command worked
		back when you were a resident.  In other words, it will give
		you a list of all the privileges that the names user has.  If
		given no argument, it will tell you what your own privs are.

  Format: privs <name>
