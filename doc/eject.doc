  eject	- This command is used to throw a newbie (ie, a non-resident
		character) off the program.  Don't use it for fun, it's there
		for use when a newbie is being abusive of offensive, and won't
		take the hint that they're not appreciated.  That said, don't
		hesitate to eject someone who IS being truly offensive, or who
		logs in with an offensive name.

  Format: eject <name> <reason for ejection>
