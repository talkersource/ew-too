  reset_squish - This command can be used on someone after they've been
		squished, and will allow them to reconnect before the time
		indicated in the original squish time has elapsed.  Especially
		if you mistyped and squished someone for 100 minutes instead
		of the 10 you meant. :)

  Format: reset_squish <name>
