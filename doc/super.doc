Ok, there has been lots of hassle recently about the effectiveness of
the superusers and such, so here is what's going to happen about it.

The first thing to notice is that you upper superusers will you have
much more power. Naturally, with that will come more responsibility.
You are being trusted with more powerful, and potentially abusable
functions. In return we expect you to use these commands in a
responsible manner and to not abuse them. So then, we will expect that
superuser commands are not used for 'personal' reasons or simply
because someone is asking for it. The reason ? Doing so destroys the
faith that normal users should have in a superusers ability to make
fair unbiased decisions and the whole concept of having superusers
will fail if normal users don't trust them. This may sound ultra
serious, but it IS important so respect it. Anyway, 'nuff said.

Ok, what are upper sus gonna get ?

Recently, you've been given 'nuke'. This command completely wipes
all the database information about a person. When the program is
closed to newbies its as effective as a banish. It does have other
uses too, since it wipes everything completely, it can be used to
'unbanish' someone who has been banished, thus letting them back into
the program.

You will get a new command 'warn'. This is a non blockable tell to
someone, and should be used to warn them if they are misbehaving
(funnily enough). It comes with a beep, blank lines above and below,
and highlighted if hitells is on. It is also logged. Don't even think
of using this command simply to get through if someone is blocking
you, it is there to warn people only. DO use this command though. I
there are instances when you may not have time to warn someone, but in
the majority of cases I would expect that if someone gets
ejected/squished and especially if they are nuked/banished there is at
least one warning before hand.

Sometime in the future, when I get round to it, there will be a
temporary banish command.

The are plenty of 'don'ts' in the text above. It isn't all one sided
though, if you use the commands sensibly and in the way they are
intended to be used, you can expect full support from the admin. We
are putting the responsibility onto your shoulders. For instance if
you make the decision to banish someone, then we won't undo it. You
have the means to do it yourself, and it will be up to you to do so.
Any mail that me or Mike receives on the subject (as long as it isn't
a complaint specifically about your ability) will simply be forwarded
to you for you to explain.

On the subject of lower su's, we are going to try the following
scheme. Upper su's will 'sponsor' people to become lower su. In other
words the upper su sponsor will be completely responsible for the
actions of the lower su's below them, just as us admin are the ones
responsible for the upper su. 
Since we are the ones that actually have to grant the commands out, me
and Mike will have to be told who you wish to be lower su's and we
will have a final veto. The idea of this is to give a better 'spread'
of superusers, since the admin alone can't know everybody. It is NOT
to simply suggest friends, or people who have done you favours etc, in
fact people like that are LESS likely to become su simply because we
will be more suspicious. Please look at suggesting new superusers from
an oblique, realistic angle. If you keep suggesting 'duds', then any
people who you suggest that really might be good superusers will have
less chance of being accepted. Again, we are trusting you to get it
right ...

Last thing to note is that there is a new login for new users. This
explains certain aspects of the program, along with a few guidelines
for its use. This means that new players should not be ignorant of the
rules, and hence this gives you a bit more freedom in dealing with
them. 

Ok, finally reached the end. These things aren't set in stone. If you
have sensible comments or suggestions then of course let them be
known, don't sit around and sulk.
