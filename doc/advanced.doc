	With advanced level SuperUser privs, come a whole load of shiny new
commands, and a whole load more responsibilities too.  By now you should have
got the hang of being an SU, and the responsibilities are basically the same,
except now of course you may have to keep the basic SU's in line.

	The extra commands that you have are..

	banish		blankpass	list_res
	nuke		squish		remove_shout
	reset_squish	splat		validate_email
