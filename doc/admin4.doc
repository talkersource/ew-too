mail :

view			* same as 'check mail'
sent			* similar to view, except for mail someone has
			* sent 


news :

view			- same as 'check news'


room :

transfer		- transfer the ownership of the current room
			  to someone else.


* Also be aware, that no checks are made when an admin character moves
* from room to room. This allows entrance into a room that your not
* invited into etc etc
* Use with care, as confidence in the program could be damaged by
* abuse of this facility


Grant levels :

base   		- without this, they aren't deemed a resident 
list    	- allows list use
echo		- allows echoing
mail		- allows mail use
build		- allows room editing
residency	- a combination of all the above (there are separate
		  privs in the general residency so that they can be
 		  REMOVED later if abused [for instance mail could be
                  removed for someone sending abusive mail])
		  remember, residency should be added using the
		  'resident' command as opposed to granting it
see_inet	- be able to list inet addresses
see_echo	- allow use of 'seeecho' command
eject		- allow use of eject command for ejecting non
		  resident. (with any priv above or including eject
		  the person is considered a superuser [ie they see su
		  messages])
squish		- allow use of the squish command (eject on anybody)
r_only		- allow use of the resident command (for granting res
		  to non ressies)

there will be a general superuser priv in here at this point somewhere
(sometime)

grant           - this shouldn't really be a separate priv, it should
                  be included in admin, please don't grant to non admin
admin           - the top priv.
