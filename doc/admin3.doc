squish                  - boot anybody off the program (as opposed to
			  eject that only works on non ressies)
			  No reason is necessary as it is assumed
			  people with squish will know for sure what
			  they are doing.
			  It prevents them from logging on for a set time
			  (defaults to a minute).
shutdown		- shut the program down
sync			- sync the player file according to first
			  letter of the arg (dump to disk, probably be
			  a delay too, maybe of a second or so)
test			- test fn, DON'T USE
unlink			- remove someone from the room link tables
			  leaving them 'nowhere' (would probably crash
			  the prog)
unbanish  		- Unbanishes a person, unless they don't properly
			  exist, in which case it nukes the name.
validate_email		- sets a flag in someone's email to make it
			  valid so that the player will save. This is
			  for use only with people who swear they
			  haven't got an email address (if the email
			  is left blank, or not validated, their
			  character would not save) 
view_note	        - allows viewing of info about a note	
where			- shows people who are hidden as well.
wall			- non blockable shout, with beep to everyone
			  on the program
