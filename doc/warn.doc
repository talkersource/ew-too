  warn - This command is used, rather unsurprisingly, to warn people.  It's
		similar to a tell, except that it comes highlighted, with a
		beep, and blank lines above and below, and it's not blockable.
		Oh, and it's logged, so if you can make it vaguely amusing as
		well as being for a serious purpose, it'll be more interesting
		for the person reading the logs.  DON'T use this command
		frivolously, though - if someone is ignoring you, then mail
		them, or get someone else to talk to them.  This command
		should ONLY be used if someone is being abusive, offensive,
		or annoying to other users in general, and hasn't responded
		to polite requests.

  Format: warn <name> <warning message>
