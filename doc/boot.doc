  boot - This command changes a little with your superuser status.  Whereas
		before, it could only be used to throw someone out of your
		own rooms, you may now also use it to kick someone from the
		hilltop into a dark room (which is about six rooms away from
		the hilltop), and they'll be prevented from trans'ing or
		visiting for a minute or two to prevent them from returning
		immediately.  You'll only be able to boot people _below_ your
		own priv level, however.  Use this command if someone's being
		abusive or offensive on the hilltop, and you don't think it
		fully warrants an eject (or, of course, if the person being
		abusive is a resident, and you're a basic SU who can't use
		the squish command).

  Format: boot <name>
