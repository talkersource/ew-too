  off_duty - This is the command to use when you feel like a bit of peace and
		quiet, and don't want to be bugged for help.  When you
		activate it, all your superuser abilities (apart from the
		ability to return to duty) are disabled; you're functionally
		equivalent to a normal resident.  To go back on duty, just
		use the on_duty command.

  Format: off_duty
