  su - To send a message to all connected SU's.  It was originally written by
		Burble, and intended to be for purely administrative sort of
		talk, but you'll find it gets used for more general chat these
		days.  Anyway, the command to talk on the SU channel is this
		one, and it's pretty easy to use.

  Format: su <message>
