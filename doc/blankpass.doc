  blankpass - This command is used to blank a resident's password.  DON'T use
		it without proof of identity, though.  If someone logs in, and
		asks you to blank the password of a resident character, then:
		If their email address is publicly readable (ie, if you do
		finger <name> you see an email address in there), then get
		them to email you from that account, requesting a password
		blank.  If their email address is NOT public, then tell them
		that they'll have to get an administrator to sort their
		problem.

  Format: blankpass <name> [<new_password>]
