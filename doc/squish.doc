  squish - The big brother of the 'eject' command, it's essentially the same,
		apart from three shinier features.  One, it doesn't need to be
		given a reason, since by this time we assume you know what
		you're doing.  Two, it'll throw anyone who has less privs than
		you off the program, whether they're a newbie, a resident, or
		a superuser.  And three, you can specify a time that the named
		person shouldn't be allowed to connect for, in minutes
		(default time is a minute).

  Format: squish <name> <time>
