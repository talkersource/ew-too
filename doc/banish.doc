banish - This command should be used with EXTREME caution, because - spookily
		enough - it banishes someone from the program.  Yes, that's
		right, it stops them from logging in with that character ever
		again (well, unless they get unbanished).  Essentially, this
		command should only be used on resident characters who are
		consistently abusive and offensive - as a rough guide, if
		they've failed to get a clue after you've warned them,
		squished them, and warned them AGAIN for being abusive, it's
		probably about time to dust off your banish command.

  Format: banish <name>
