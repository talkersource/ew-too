:general

			   How to use help
			   ---------------
 It is hugely recommended that you read help pages 1 though 14 for a
    quick guide on the commands available and general information.
			 (Do help 1 ... etc)

	       help index gives an index to pages 1-21

	 help <command> now gives help on individual commands

	Thanks to Batfink for the original help files, Sparrow for 
          the updated ones, and Xolf for some of the others...

	       help index gives an index to pages 1-21

        Do 'help rooms' 'help lists' and 'help basic' to get a
           basic overview of what some of the commands do.

Look around and enjoy the place. If you would like a permanent account
   then ask around for 'residency' and you'll usually find there's
		 someone around who can help you out.
