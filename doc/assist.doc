  assist - This is a simple command, essentially to avoid the situation where
		someone asks for help, and half-a-dozen superusers all offer
		to help, and the poor person needing help is left frantically
		telling to them all that they've already had offers of help.
		When you 'assist' someone, they get a message that you're
		willing to help, and all other connected SU's get a message
		that you are helping the named person.

  Format: assist <name>
