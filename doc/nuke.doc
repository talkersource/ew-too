nuke - A command to use with lots of caution, as it wipes a playerfile
		completely.  Yup, that's right - if you nuke someone, they'll
		be a newbie if they log in again with that name.  It's NOT
		reversible (unless someone digs around in backup files), so
		DON'T use it unless it's really really necessary.  (Usually,
		banish is a better bet, since at least admin can undo that.
		In theory, anyway. :) ).
