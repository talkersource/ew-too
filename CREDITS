The original EW-too (standing for Elsewhere II) was written by Simon Marsh
during the winter of 1992/93. 

Later in 1993, Chris Hughes made modifications, and added more code to the
base source.

The help documentation has had many contributors, particularly, Simon Marsh,
Chris Hughes, Mike Wheaton, Batfink (who was responsible for the original
layout), Xolf, Sparrow and Ulyanov.

Many thanks go to the innumerable people who have provided countless 
suggestions (whether taken up or not), help, time and effort in order to
make the program what it is now. Names that must be mentioned are Mike
Wheaton, Daniel Stephens, Rod Morgan, and the administrators of 
marble.bu.edu.

Without these people, you wouldn't be reading this now.


Simon Marsh,  September 1994
